        calculate the ngrams of a set of keystrokes, where an ngram is
        [{ (k1,k2,...,kn) : [count, mean, variance] }, { ki : count, avg_duration }]
        for a given n (we'll probably stick to digrams)

        These are two collections: 
        - latencies is a mapping from an ordered tuple of n keys
        - count is the frequency of that sequence of keys in the keystrokes
        - mean is the /latency/: the average time between the first key-down and the last key-down
        of the sequence 
        - variance is the sample variance of the latency (the one with denom n - 1)
        
        - durations is a mapping from individual keys to their count and avg_duration. A count is
        kept so that the duration averages (how long the keys are held down) can be updated
        - durations does not depend on n, and we lose some detail in not measuring the duration of
        each key press within the context of its ngram. But I'm not sure how powerful of a biometric
        profile the durations of distinct keys even are.

        cutoff is the number of milliseconds between key_down events to "atomize" keystrokes
        by. That is, if there are more than cutoff milliseconds between two separate key down
        events, we consider that the end of a sequence of typing and stop considering it when
        building ngrams.
